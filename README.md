# Readable React Nanodegree Project

This is a Reddit like web app built with React and Redux where users are able to add, remove, edit, vote and order posts and comments.

## How to run 

To get started first you need to start the API server, then the react app.

* Install and start the API server
    - `cd api-server`
    - `npm install`
    - `node server`
* In another terminal window, run the front-end application
    - `cd frontend`
    - `npm install`
    - `npm start`

## Front-End
